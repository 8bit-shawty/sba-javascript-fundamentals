# SBA JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS
Skill bases assessment testing our knowledge to use control flow, loops, iteration, error handling, and functions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Javascript

**Goal:** To analyze and transform data into an array of objects, while also handling all logic within our function

## Lessons Learned:

Discovered new ways to iterate through objects and really spent time reading MDN web docs to see how I was able to handle the data that I created and return it into the format that was given to me. There was a lot of trial and error to get things the way I ultimately wanted to and I think its good that this happened because I finally seen my data populate in the end.
